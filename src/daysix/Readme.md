The question test piece involved finding the maximum amount of time that a button can be pressed on a car in order to go maximum distance.

The test input was:
```
Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200
```

The maximum distance a car could travel is given by the equation `x(Time - x)` and we have to find for how many integer times the distance 'record' can be exceeded.

Part 2 involved removing the spaces from the above so the input becomes:
```
Time:      71530
Distance:  940200
```
The same equation can be used.

My puzzle input was:
```
Time:        61     70     90     66
Distance:   643   1184   1362   1041
```
with the solution being `35150181`
